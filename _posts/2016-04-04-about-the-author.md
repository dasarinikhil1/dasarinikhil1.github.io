My journey involves not just mastering the intricacies of IT, but also delving into the intersection of business and technology.

My academic pursuit stems from a deep-seated passion for the development of both business and technology. As a student at UT Dallas, I am honing my skills and knowledge to become an innovator and leader in the dynamic IT industry. My quest for excellence led me to major in Information Technology Systems, a field that continuously fascinates me with its ever-evolving landscape.

Engaging in such events fuels my passion for innovation and helps me stay abreast of the latest trends in the ever-evolving realm of technology.
